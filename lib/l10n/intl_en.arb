    "stressTitle1": "Psychological Stress During Pregnancy",
    "stressText1": "Psychological stress during pregnancy is a time when women experience a lot of changes, whether in their bodies or emotions. These changes can add psychological pressures such as tension and stress, which can lead to sleep problems, headaches, and loss of appetite. Severe and chronic psychological stress for an extended period can even cause high blood pressure, heart diseases, premature birth, or having a baby with low birth weight (less than 2 kilograms).",
    "stressTitle2": "Impact of Psychological Stress on the Fetus",
    "stressText2": "Psychological stress and tension are normal experiences during pregnancy. When feeling stressed, the body releases cortisol and other stress hormones, which can increase heart rate. While this stress can be temporary, in cases of continuous and chronic stress, it can lead to an inflammatory response that affects the health of both the mother and the fetus. Studies have shown that chronic psychological stress can increase the risk of premature birth and having a baby with lower than normal birth weight, potentially causing subtle differences in brain development and behavioral issues in the child. Stress may also lead to symptoms in the mother, such as headaches, sleep problems, or overeating.",
    "stressTitle3": "Other Problems Caused by Psychological Stress",
    "stressText3": "Preeclampsia is one of the pregnancy complications that affect blood pressure and can lead to premature birth.

These toxins enter the placenta (the tissue that connects the mother to the fetus), preventing the fetus from receiving the necessary nutrients and oxygen it needs for growth.
